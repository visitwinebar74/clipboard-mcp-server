## Overview

Service providers are exported from `@cyanheads/mcp-ts-core/services`. These are documented here for servers that use the built-in providers.

All services follow the **init/accessor pattern**: initialized in `setup()`, accessed at request time via lazy accessor. See the `add-service` skill for the full pattern.
